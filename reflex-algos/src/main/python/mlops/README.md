## ParallelM's MLOps API Documentation

The ParallelM mlops library provides users the ability to instrument their machine learning programs and components to report various kinds of statistics into MCenter. It also provides an API to query for statistics and objects generated by programs running in the same MLApp.

mlops is currently supported for PySpark and Python.
