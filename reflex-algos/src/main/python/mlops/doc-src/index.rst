ParallelM's MLOps API Documentation
===================================

The ParallelM mlops library provides users the ability to instrument their machine
learning programs and components to report various kinds of statistics.
It also provides an API to query for statistics and objects generated by programs running in
the same MLApp.

mlops is currently supported for PySpark and Python.
